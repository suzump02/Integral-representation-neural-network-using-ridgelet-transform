## Theoretical framework
We choose the hyperbolic tangent function $\tanh(z)$ as the active function $\eta(z)$. The Fourier transform of the hyperbolic tangent function is given by :
$$
\widehat{\eta}(\zeta) = \frac{-i\pi}{2 \sinh(\frac{\pi}{2}\zeta)}.
$$

**REMARK:**Coefficients of the reconduction formula($m=1$)
$$
K_{\eta, \psi} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\oerline{\widehat{\psi}(\zeta)}{\widehat{\eta}(\zeta)}}{|\zeta|} d\zeta
$$

Then, to confirm the reconstruction theorem, the correspondingã€€function $\psi$ was set up as follows
